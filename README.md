# About the Project
## Introduction
This project consists of two tasks:
### Task A: Modelling - Classification
Two datasets have been provided: LoanData_train.csv and LoanData_test.csv. Both datasets are on loans given by The Lending Club. We have taken 10,000 of these loans and simplified the data to 11 variables. Original data can be downloaded from : 
https://www.lendingclub.com/info/download-data.action.

### Task B: Modelling - Regression
In this task, auto_mpg data is used to build a linear regression model in order to predict a car's fuel efficiency based on its other characteristics. Dataset is available at: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Auto+MPG.

### Task C: Sampling
In this task, rejection sampling, simple bayesian network, gibbs sampling has been performed using R.
