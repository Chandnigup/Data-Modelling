# About the Project
## Introduction
This project consists of two tasks:
### Task A: Modelling - Classification
Two datasets have been provided: LoanData_train.csv and LoanData_test.csv. Both datasets are on loans given by The Lending Club. We have taken 10,000 of these loans and simplified the data to 11 variables. Original data can be downloaded from : 
https://www.lendingclub.com/info/download-data.action.

<b>1.</b> Model is built in order to predict whether a loan will be repaid (loan status) based on the other variables. Also, which is better model to be used for this particular data is also discussed.
<b>2.</b> Changing grade variable into a numeric variable will improve predictive accuracy or not has been discussed.
